<p>Trump's latest executive order concludes:</p>
<p class='joke'>
    ENSURING A GOVERNMENT THAT ANSWERS TO THE PEOPLE: This order fulfills President Trump’s promise to restore constitutional governance and accountability to the entire executive branch.  
    Executive power without responsibility has no place in our Republic. The United States was founded on the principle that the government should be accountable to the people. That is why the Founders created a single President who is alone vested with “the executive Power” and responsibility to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  
    Voters and the President can now hold all Federal agencies—not just Cabinet departments—responsible for their decisions, as the Constitution demands.

  Trump openly attacks with intent to completly destroy u.s. constitutional governance, yet claims to restore it? That, "Executive power without responsibility has no place in our repblic" is the topic sentence to a paragraph which concludes, "That is why the Founders created a single President who is alone vested with _the executive Power_" to decide what the law is, is an attack on the very concept of written language with interpretable meaning.   
<p><b>There is no space for confusion: the authoritarian take over is currently being implemented</b>.</p>
<p>
  The relevant part of the executive order reads: (emphasis added)
</p>
<p class='joke'>
  Sec. 7.  Rules of Conduct Guiding Federal Employees’ Interpretation of the Law. The President and the Attorney General, subject to the President’s supervision and control, shall provide <b>authoritative</b> interpretations of law for the executive branch.  The President and the Attorney General’s opinions on questions of law are controlling on all employees in the conduct of their official duties.  No employee of the executive branch acting in their official capacity may advance an interpretation of the law as the position of the United States that contravenes <b>the President or the Attorney General’s opinion</b> on a matter of law, including but not limited to the issuance of regulations, guidance, and positions advanced in litigation, unless authorized to do so by the President or in writing by the Attorney General.
