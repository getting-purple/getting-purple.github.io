Trump's latest executive order concludes:  
<br>

  
    ENSURING A GOVERNMENT THAT ANSWERS TO THE PEOPLE: This order fulfills President Trump’s promise to restore constitutional governance and accountability to the entire executive branch.  
    Executive power without responsibility has no place in our Republic. The United States was founded on the principle that the government should be accountable to the people. That is why the Founders created a single President who is alone vested with “the executive Power” and responsibility to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  
    Voters and the President can now hold all Federal agencies—not just Cabinet departments—responsible for their decisions, as the Constitution demands.

Trump openly attacks with intent to completly destroy u.s. constitutional governance, yet claims to restore it? That, "Executive power without responsibility has no place in our repblic" is the topic sentence to a paragraph which concludes, "That is why the Founders created a single President who is alone vested with _the executive Power_" to decide what the law is, is an attack on the very concept of written language with interpretable meaning.  
  
__There is no space for confusion: the authoritarian take over is currently being implemented__.
