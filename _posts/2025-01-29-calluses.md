The dead skin cells on my fingertips remember better  
than the muscles in my hands.  
Last monthâ€™s guitar practice

Testimony to feats I can no longer accomplish.

The dead skin cells on the palms of my hands remember better  
than the muscles in my arms.  
Rocks once climbed, or  
weights once lifted, or  
testimony to feats I can no longer accomplish  
burned lightly into the flesh.
