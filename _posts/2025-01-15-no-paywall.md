Hitting a paywall blocking an article is a frustrating experience you've probably had if you read the news online -- whether its blocking you from reading critical information about an ongoing emergency event, staying informed about local politics, or just reading that article your dad sent you because you know he's going to want to talk about it the next time you call him -- but it doesn't have to be. Here are some ways you can bypass paywalls to read many articles you want to access without paying for them:

[The Wayback Machine ~ https://web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20250115022102/http://getting-purple.com/)  
The Wayback Machine is a great resource for many things on the internet: this Internet Archive collects snapshots of websites frozen in time to archive information across the internet for posterity even if the original websites change or are taken down. This works for articles too, because it can archive the version of an article behind the paywall for anyone to read:  
1. Hith a Paywall  
2. Copy the URL of the article you are blocked out of  
3. Go to  https://web.archive.org  
4. Paste the article URL into the WaybackMachine search bar  
5. Click on any / the most recently archived version of the article  
6. Read and enjoy!

*Copy and Paste*  
You may have noticed that many article paywalls work by first loading the entire article, then a second later popping up a window blocking the article text that says something like "Pay us Bitch". Most article paywalls that work this way can be circumvented pretty easily.  
1. Click on the article / refresh the article page  
1. After the article text loads but before the paywall popup appears, quickly, 
1. CTRL-A (SELECT ALL) 
1. CTRL-C (COPY)  
1. Open your favorite notes app / word editor / google docs  
1. CTRL-V (PASTE) the article text into your blank document  
1. Read and enjoy!
